🛑 Smart Traffic Sign Recognition System
🔍 Overview
Smart Traffic Sign Recognition System is an AI-powered application that classifies traffic signs from uploaded images using a deep learning model. Built using Streamlit and TensorFlow, this system is ideal for autonomous vehicle systems, road safety monitoring, and smart traffic solutions.

📂 Dataset
The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), a widely used dataset in traffic sign recognition research.

✨ Features
✅ Deep Learning-Powered – Built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high performance

✅ High Accuracy – Achieves 96.5% accuracy on test data

✅ Streamlit UI – Interactive, user-friendly web interface

✅ Auto Preprocessing – Grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, normalization

✅ Instant Results – Real-time predictions on uploaded images

✅ Optimized Input Pipeline – Uses OpenCV for efficient image processing

✅ Lightweight & Fast – Quick deployment without requiring a heavy backend

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend/UI: Streamlit

Backend/Model: TensorFlow, Keras

Image Processing: OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow

Deployment Ready: Can run locally with minimal setup

🚀 How It Works
Upload an image of a traffic sign using the file uploader.

The system preprocesses the image (grayscale, normalize, resize).

The trained CNN model classifies the image.

The predicted sign name is displayed instantly.
